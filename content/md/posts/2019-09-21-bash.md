A shell or command-line interpreter (CLI) provides an interface for a user to input commands in Unix-like operating systems. The shell can be used as an interactive command prompt and also written as a scripting programming language. Typically users interact with the shell using a text window called a terminal emulator, that is a computer program that emulates a video terminal. The shell maybe executing directly on the local hardware or remotely connecting to a server via Secure Shell (SSH). All Unix shells provide filename wildcarding, piping, here documents, command substitution, variables and control structures for condition-testing and iteration [[^1]].

The Bourne Again SHell (bash) is the Unix-shell and command language for the GNU operating system written by Brian Fox and first released in 1989. It serves as a replacement to its predecessor the Bourne Shell (sh), and has a superset of its features. The bash shell incorporates features from the Bourne shell (sh) the KornShell (ksh) and the C shell (csh). For example the expansion of the tilde `~` character to the value held in the `$HOME` environment variable comes from the C shell. Bash has gone on to become the most popular shell among users of Linux and the default on many distributions [[^2]].

In addition to the KornShell and C shell there are many alternative shells available such as the Z shell (zsh) and the Friendly Interactive Shell (fish). Even though more modern shells are available with it's large user base and long service bash remains a mature and stable choice, despite this vulnerabilities have been found in Bash.

# Shellshock
---
The shellshock software bug is an example of a vulnerability found in Bash and first disclosed on 24 September 2014 by StÃ©phane Chazelas [[^3]]. Shellshock is a security bug that was introduced on 5 August 1989, and released in Bash version 1.03 on 1 September 1989 causing Bash to execute commands from environment variables unintentionally. Using this vulnerability attackers can remotely issue commands on a server. Many machines were vulnerable since many internet and network services such as web servers use environment variables to communicate with the server's operating system.

A patch was worked on with the maintainers of Bash and a fix issued for the bug with identifier CVE-2014-6271 [[^4]]. However within hours of disclosure attackers already started exploiting Shellshock, creating botnets of compromised computers to perform distributed denial-of-service attacks and vulnerability scanning.

The bug exploits a problem sanitising environment variables before being executed, this allows attackers to send commands to a remote server through HTTP requests and get them executed by the web server operating system.

Although the majority of machines will have been patched by now, any organisation without proper patch management running a version of bash older than 4.3 may still be vulnerable. You can check if your system is vulnerable by issuing the following command in Bash:

``` shell
env x='() { :;}; echo vulnerable' bash -c "echo this is a test"
```

This bug exploits a flaw in Bash's "function export" feature, whereby one Bash process can share command scripts with other Bash processes that it executes. These data are shared between processes by encoding the scripts in a table of environment variables. Every new Bash process scans the table for encoded scripts, creating a command for each environment variable and executes that command. This can be used for example over HTTP to create an environment variable on a remote machine that is a function export, this can contain additional unsanitised malicious code that gets executed on the remote machine by other bash processes.

# Pipelines
---
Bash also allows users to take advantage of Unix pipelines with the pipe `|` symbol. These are a mechanism for inter-process communication using message passing. Essentially pipelines allow bash commands to be chained together in a pipeline by passing the output of one command as the input of another. The output text of each process (stdout) is passed directly as input (stdin) to the next one. The second process is started as the first process is still executing, and they are executed concurrently. Given here are some examples of pipelines and a brief explanation of how they can be used to direct the standard output and standard error streams to file:

- `command > output.txt`&nbsp;&ndash; the standard output stream from `command` is redirected to the `output.txt` file only, it will not be visible in the terminal. If the file already exists, it gets overwritten.

- `command >> output.txt`&nbsp;&ndash; the standard output stream from `command` is redirected to the `output.txt` file only, it will not be visible in the terminal. If the file already exists, the new data will get appended to the end of the file.

- `command 2> output.txt`&nbsp;&ndash; the standard error stream from `command` will be redirected to the `output.txt` file only, it will not be visible in the terminal. If the file already exists, it gets overwritten.

- `command 2>> output.txt`&nbsp;&ndash; the standard error stream will be redirected to the `output.txt` file only, it will not be visible in the terminal. If the file already exists, the new data will get appended to the end of the file.

- `command &> output.txt`&nbsp;&ndash; both the standard output and standard error stream will be redirected to the `output.txt` file only, nothing will be visible in the terminal. If the file already exists, it gets overwritten.

- `command &>> output.txt`&nbsp;&ndash; both the standard output and standard error stream will be redirected to the `output.txt` file only, nothing will be visible in the terminal. If the file already exists, the new data will get appended to the end of the file..

- `command | tee output.txt`&nbsp;&ndash; standard output stream will be copied to the `output.txt` file, it will still be visible in the terminal. If the file already exists, it gets overwritten.

- `command | tee -a output.txt`&nbsp;&ndash; the standard output stream will be copied to the `output.txt` file, it will still be visible in the terminal. If the file already exists, the new data will get appended to the end of the file.

- `command |& tee output.txt`&nbsp;&ndash; both the standard output and standard error streams will be copied to the `output.txt` file while still being visible in the terminal. If the file already exists, it gets overwritten.

- `command |& tee -a output.txt`&nbsp;&ndash; both the standard output and standard error streams will be copied to the `output.txt` file while still being visible in the terminal. If the file already exists, the new data will get appended to the end of the file.

- `time python -u </path/to/python_script.py> | tee -a <std_output.txt>`&nbsp;&ndash; example with python script `-u` writes line by line not all at once at the end time gives a time for execution.

# Extra Command Line Utilities
---
As well as having a rich in built set of commands, and added power using Unix pipelines there are many additional utilities that can be used from a bash command line. For example these are some command line utilities that I find particularly useful:

- [htop](https://htop.dev/) - an interactive process viewer.
- [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) - a command line json processor.
- [mosh](https://mosh.org/) - the mobile shell.
- [ncdu](https://dev.yorhel.nl/ncdu) - Ncdu is a disk usage analyzer with an ncurses interface.
- [nethogs](https://github.com/raboof/nethogs) - NetHogs is a small 'net top' tool. Instead of breaking the traffic down per protocol or per subnet, like most tools do, it groups bandwidth by process.
- [ranger](https://ranger.github.io/) - text based file manager.
- [tig](https://jonas.github.io/tig/) - text mode interface for git.
- [tldr](https://tldr.sh/) - simplified and community driven man pages.
- [tmux](https://tmux.github.io/) -  an open-source terminal multiplexer, it lets you switch easily between several programs in one terminal, detach them (they keep running in the background) and reattach them to a different terminal.
- [tree](https://linux.die.net/man/1/tree) - a recursive directory listing program.
- [visidata](https://www.visidata.org/) - an opensource data multi-tool.
- [z - jump around](https://github.com/rupa/z) - allows you to jump quickly between directories you frequently visit.

# Conclusion
---
Here I've given some background to different shells and described very briefly where the Bourne Again SHell arose from. It forms a very powerful and commonly available interface to Unix systems, but other shells are also worth exploring.

The commands described here could also be put together into scripting `.sh` files and executed as a sequence, this is known as shell scripting, and after learning some of the core functions of Bash is an easy next step to learn. There are many more utilities that can extend the default Bash experience, that make shell extensible and still relevant many years after it's inception.
