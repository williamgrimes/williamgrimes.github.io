<div id="about">
  <p>
  Welcome to my personal website.
  <br><br>
  My name is William Grimes, and I'm a passionate computer scientist with a keen interest in machine learning. Over the years, I've worked on numerous projects and have gained valuable experience and knowledge that I'm excited to share with you.
  <br><br>
  Through this site I intend to document my various projects and interests, whether it's a post covering a personal computing project, a public machine learning project, or a technical post about a subject of interest.
  <br><br>
  The process of writing I find powerful to deeply engage with a subject, identify gaps in my knowledge, and consolidate learning.
  <br><br>
  If you have any questions or topics you'd like me to cover, or would like to collaborate on a project feel free to reach out and let me know.
  <br><br>
  Thanks for stopping by!
